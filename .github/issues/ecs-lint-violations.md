# Message/Event Separation Violations (Automated Lint)

This issue tracks all current violations of the MessageWriter/Event separation rule as detected by the static analysis linter. Each item below should be addressed by refactoring the function to move immediate side-effects into observer systems, or by switching to the correct event/trigger pattern.

## Violations

- [ ] `toggle_cheat_mode_input` in `src/systems/cheat_mode.rs`
- [ ] `detect_powerup_brick_collisions` in `src/systems/paddle_size.rs`
- [ ] `detect_ball_loss` in `src/systems/respawn.rs`
- [ ] `respawn_executor` in `src/systems/respawn.rs`

---

**How to fix:**
- Move any `commands.spawn`, `commands.entity`, `audio.play`, etc. out of the function that uses `MessageWriter<T>`, and into a separate observer system that reacts to the message/event.
- If the logic is truly immediate, use an observer/trigger pattern instead of a buffered message.

**Reference:** See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (VIII. Bevy 0.17 Mandates & Prohibitions) for architectural requirements.
