# Message/Event Separation Violations (Automated Lint)

This issue tracks all current violations of the MessageWriter/Event separation rule as detected by the static analysis linter. Each item below should be addressed by refactoring the function to move immediate side-effects into observer systems, or by switching to the correct event/trigger pattern.

## Violations



**How to fix:**
### Guidance
- If the side-effect is immediate and reactive (e.g., UI, sound, spawning), consider using an `Event` (with `#[derive(Event)]`) and an observer system (`commands.observe()`).
- If the data is meant to be buffered and processed later (e.g., logs, telemetry), keep the `MessageWriter` but ensure no immediate side-effects are in the same function.
- Refactor by moving immediate side-effects into a separate system that observes the appropriate `Event` or `Trigger<T>`, not the `Message`.
**Reference:** See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (VIII. Bevy 0.17 Mandates & Prohibitions) for architectural requirements.
