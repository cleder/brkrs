# Placeholder for Brick 41 Extra Life Sound

This file will be replaced with the actual audio asset for brick 41 destruction sound.

Brick 41 grants +1 life when destroyed and should have a distinct, rewarding sound.

Temporary: Uses generic brick_destroy.ogg as fallback until unique asset is created.
