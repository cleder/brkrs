## Testing & TDD

- The project mandates **Test-Driven Development** for all feature work: tests must be written and committed before implementation and a failing-test commit (red) must exist as proof before implementation begins.
- Include unit tests, integration/acceptance tests for user scenarios, and WASM-targeted tests when behavior differs on the web.
- CI pipelines MUST enforce tests and reject merges that do not comply with the tests-first proof.
