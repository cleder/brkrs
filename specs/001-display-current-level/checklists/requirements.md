- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Validation Results

All checklist items pass validation.
The specification reflects the decision to omit in-play progress indicators; requirements and success criteria were updated accordingly.

## Notes

- The decision to omit in-play progress is documented in Assumptions and FR-004; pause/summary screens may still display final progress where useful.
