# Feature Specification: Brkrs Complete Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-complete-game`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Brkrs is a classic Breakout/Arkanoid style game implemented in Rust with the Bevy game engine. It's a feature-rich clone with advanced gameplay mechanics beyond the basic Breakout formula. It features a paddle that can be controlled with the mouse, in all directions (left/right (x), up/down (y)). If the player is moving the paddle to the right when the ball makes contact, the game calculates a greater horizontal velocity component in the rightward direction, sending the ball off at a sharper horizontal angle. Conversely, moving the paddle to the left imparts a leftward 'english.' The mouse wheel controls the rotation of the paddle. It uses 3D rendering to display the bricks, the walls, and the ball. The game will be implemented in 3D but constrained to a 2D plane above the ground. The game area is divided into a 22x22 grid, the stones are placed into this grid and fill a grid cell."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Gameplay Loop (Priority: P1)

A player launches the game, starts playing with mouse-controlled paddle movement, and experiences the core ball-paddle-brick physics interaction with mouse-based ball steering.

**Why this priority**: This is the absolute core of the game - without basic paddle control, ball physics, and brick destruction, there is no game. This MVP provides the fundamental gameplay experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the game, moving the paddle with the mouse (X and Y directions), hitting the ball, and destroying at least one brick. Delivers a playable Breakout experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the game is launched, **When** the player moves the mouse left/right, **Then** the paddle moves horizontally (X-axis) in the corresponding direction
2. **Given** the game is launched, **When** the player moves the mouse up/down, **Then** the paddle moves vertically (Y-axis) in the corresponding direction
3. **Given** the game is launched, **When** the player scrolls the mouse wheel, **Then** the paddle rotates around its center point
4. **Given** the paddle is moving right, **When** the ball collides with the paddle, **Then** the ball receives additional rightward velocity (english effect)
5. **Given** the paddle is moving left, **When** the ball collides with the paddle, **Then** the ball receives additional leftward velocity (english effect)
6. **Given** the ball is in play, **When** the ball collides with a brick, **Then** the brick is destroyed and removed from the play area
7. **Given** the ball is in play, **When** the ball collides with a wall, **Then** the ball bounces according to physics reflection
8. **Given** the ball exits the play area at the bottom, **When** the ball passes the lower boundary, **Then** the player loses a life

### User Story 2 - Game State Management (Priority: P2)

A player navigates through different game states including starting, pausing, game over, and progressing through levels.

**Why this priority**: Essential for a complete game experience, but the core gameplay (P1) must work first. This adds game flow and progression.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a game, pausing/resuming, losing all lives to trigger game over, and completing a level to advance. Delivers a structured game experience with proper state transitions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the game is launched, **When** the player is at the main menu, **Then** they can start a new game
2. **Given** a game is in progress, **When** the player presses the pause key, **Then** the game pauses and displays a pause menu
3. **Given** the game is paused, **When** the player resumes, **Then** gameplay continues from the paused state
4. **Given** the player has lost all lives, **When** the last ball is lost, **Then** the game displays a game over screen
5. **Given** all bricks in a level are destroyed, **When** the last brick is destroyed, **Then** the game transitions to the next level
6. **Given** the player completes the final level, **When** the last brick of level 77 is destroyed, **Then** the game displays a victory/completion screen

### User Story 3 - Multiple Brick Types (Priority: P3)

A player encounters different brick types with unique behaviors, adding variety and challenge to the gameplay.

**Why this priority**: Enhances gameplay depth and variety, but requires core gameplay (P1) and level progression (P2) to be functional first. Delivers the "feature-rich" aspect beyond basic Breakout.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by playing a level containing different brick types and observing varied behaviors (different hit counts, special effects, etc.). Delivers enhanced gameplay variety.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the ball hits a standard brick, **When** collision occurs, **Then** the brick is destroyed in one hit
2. **Given** the ball hits a multi-hit brick, **When** collision occurs, **Then** the brick's durability decreases and visual state changes
3. **Given** the ball hits a multi-hit brick with remaining durability, **When** collision occurs again, **Then** the brick is eventually destroyed after sufficient hits
4. **Given** the ball hits a special brick type, **When** collision occurs, **Then** unique behavior triggers (velocity modification, special effects, etc.)
5. **Given** bricks are arranged in a 22x22 grid, **When** viewing the play area, **Then** bricks properly fill grid cells without overlap

---

### User Story 4 - Level System (Priority: P4)

A player progresses through 77 unique levels with different brick layouts and challenges.

**Why this priority**: Provides long-term engagement and replayability, but depends on core gameplay (P1), state management (P2), and brick variety (P3) being complete.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading different level definitions and verifying correct brick placement and progression. Delivers extensive content and replay value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a level is loaded, **When** the level starts, **Then** bricks are spawned according to the level's layout definition
2. **Given** multiple levels exist, **When** progressing through the game, **Then** each level presents a unique brick arrangement
3. **Given** the player is on level N, **When** completing that level, **Then** the game loads level N+1
4. **Given** level progress, **When** viewing the game, **Then** the current level number is displayed to the player

---

### User Story 5 - Visual Presentation (Priority: P5)

A player experiences a visually appealing 3D-rendered game with proper lighting, shadows, and camera perspective.

**Why this priority**: Enhances player experience and game polish, but all core gameplay mechanics must be functional first. Delivers professional visual quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by launching the game and observing 3D models, lighting effects, shadows, and overhead camera view. Delivers polished visual presentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the game is running, **When** viewing the play area, **Then** all game objects (paddle, ball, bricks, walls) are rendered as 3D models
2. **Given** the game is running, **When** viewing the scene, **Then** lighting creates visible shadows and depth
3. **Given** all gameplay occurs on a 2D plane, **When** viewing the game, **Then** the camera is positioned above looking down at the play area
4. **Given** 3D objects exist, **When** they are rendered, **Then** they maintain 3D visual aesthetics while gameplay remains constrained to Y=2.0 plane
5. **Given** the game is running on native platform, **When** toggling wireframe mode, **Then** the visualization changes to wireframe rendering
6. **Given** the game is running on WASM, **When** playing in a web browser, **Then** the game renders correctly without wireframe support

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the paddle reaches the boundary of the play area (collision with walls)? Paddle bounces back proportionally to collision impulse. Balls get an impulse from the wall collision. Screen shake effect (could be implemented by moving the camera position).
- How does the system handle the ball getting stuck in a corner or between bricks?
- What happens when the ball velocity becomes too high (speed limiting)? A speed limit should be enforced,depending on the ball type. A small ball (golf ball) can reach higher speeds, a big ball (beach ball) will be slower.
- How does the game handle window resize or focus loss during gameplay? Pause the game.
- What happens when mouse input is lost or disconnected during gameplay? pause the game.
- How does the paddle rotation affect ball collision angles at extreme rotation values? Rotation angles should be limited to 45 degrees. when the paddle is rotated an angular force should be applied that nudges thepaddle back into a horizontal position.
- What happens when multiple bricks are destroyed simultaneously?
- How does the game handle loading a corrupted or missing level definition?
