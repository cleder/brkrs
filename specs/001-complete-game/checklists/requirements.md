# Specification Quality Checklist: Brkrs Complete Game

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before
proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: PASSED âœ…

The specification successfully meets all quality criteria:

- **Content Quality**: The spec focuses on user gameplay experience and
  observable behaviors without mentioning Rust, Bevy, or Rapier3D
  implementation details. It describes WHAT the game does, not HOW it's
  built.

- **Requirements**: All 42 functional requirements are testable and
  unambiguous. Each requirement describes observable behavior or user
  interactions.

- **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable and
  technology-agnostic, focusing on user-observable outcomes (frame rates,
  completion times, behavior consistency).

- **User Stories**: 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P5) cover the complete
  game experience from MVP (basic gameplay) through polish (visual
  presentation). Each story is independently testable.

- **Edge Cases**: 8 edge cases identified covering boundary conditions,
  error scenarios, and unexpected states.

- **No Clarifications Needed**: All requirements are specific enough to
  proceed with planning. The spec makes reasonable assumptions about game
  behavior based on standard Arkanoid/Breakout conventions.

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan`

**Minor Note**: The spec file has markdown linting warnings (line length
exceeding 80 characters) but these do not affect specification quality or
readiness for planning.
